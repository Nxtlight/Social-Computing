# Social-Computing

Our work is primarily educational and supports social computing research by sharing models of human behavior that can be integrated into new projects. We explore and provide examples of software design, integration, and incorporate contextual motifs through examples in Python.

The social computing concepts and models included here represent my personal interests and include topics related to our collective research in human cognition and behavior. The ongoing work is a hybrid of social, economic, psychological, and economic approaches. Consistent with their scholarly fields, these domains have traditionally looked into different problems. Social computing has focused largely on group dynamics with individuals identifying as an entity and acting in unison. Psychological modeling typically addresses individual actions mediated by individual cognitive and affective processes. Finally, economic modeling often deals with individuals as rational actors who are incentivized to act in their own interests.
